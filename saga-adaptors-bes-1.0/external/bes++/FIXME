  - in bes.[hc], many char* args can be const, which simplifies client code
  significantly

  - the bes epr struct should be exposed on .h level, so that the client can
  access the members therein.

  - why does the typemap.dat contain
    hpcp  = "http://www.platform.com/HPCProfile"
    should that not point to schemas.ggf.org?
