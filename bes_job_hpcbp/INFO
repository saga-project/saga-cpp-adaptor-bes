:IMPLEMENTS PACKAGE:
 
  - saga_package_job

:DESCRIPTION:

  The adaptor allows job submission, control and monitoring using via
  BES services.

  BES:   Basic Execution Service, see http://ogf.org/documents/GFD.108.pdf
  HPCBP: HPC Basic Profile of BES, see http://ogf.org/documents/GFD.114.pdf 

  For BES implementations, check http://ogf.org/gf/page.php?page=Standards::Implementations

  The adaptor has been tested agains ARC, SMOA, Unicore, GridSAM, BESPP
  and Gensis-II.  Please report any other working backens, and also problems 
  with such.

  Note that the used SAGA session should contain a UserPass context, 
  pointing to gthe respective certification tokens.

:KNOWN ISSUES:

  - no interactive jobs are supported (unsupported by BES).  
  - callbacks are not supported.
  - file staging support is not well tested, yet.
  - file staging does not yet support separate credentials per staging
    directive.
  - the quality of error reports varies widely, depending on the respective
    backend.
  - for Genesis-II, our code seems to include a security token into requests
    which refer to a specific job EPR.  That token is taken from the initial
    Genesis-II response which defined the EPR, but is later included w/o namespace
    qualifier - and thus rejected by some Genesis operations (e.g. job.cancel()).
  - accepted context type is UserPass, but x509 contexts should also be
    accepted.
